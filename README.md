# Word-based Dungeon Adventure ðŸ˜Ž

A simple **text-based dungeon crawler game** written in Python.
This project demonstrates recursion, randomness, and user interaction through the console.

## Features

* **Recursive Storytelling**: No loops â€” the game flow relies purely on recursion.

* **Random Encounters**: Each encounter is chosen randomly, with equal probability:

  1. **Descending Stairs**

     * Ask the player whether to go down.
     * If yes â†’ display a staircase (random size 1â€“10).
     * If no â†’ display refusal message.
  2. **Treasure Found**

     * 90% chance: **Square gem** (prints a recursive square).
     * 10% chance: **Rare diamond** (prints a recursive diamond, odd size 1â€“15).
  3. **Mirror Realm**

     * Player enters text â†’ program reverses it recursively.
  4. **Mysterious Stranger**

     * Stranger generates sentences from a grammar structure file (`stranger_structure.txt`).

* **ASCII Art**: Recursive printing of stairs, squares, and diamonds.

* **Interactive Input**: Decisions affect what you see in the dungeon.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
   cd <your-repo>
   ```

2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

3. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python "Word-based dungeon adventureðŸ˜Ž.py"
   ```

4. Follow the prompts in the console:

   * Enter how many encounters you want.
   * Respond to stairs, mirror, and other challenges.
   * Enjoy your adventure!

## File Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Word-based dungeon adventureðŸ˜Ž.py   # Main game script
â””â”€â”€ stranger_structure.txt              # Grammar rules for strangerâ€™s sentences
â”œâ”€â”€ test_game.py                       
â””â”€â”€ README.md

## Example Gameplay

```
You enter the dungeon...
How many encounters would you like to have? 2
You've found some descending stairs, would you like to go down? y
â–¥
â–¥â–¥
â–¥â–¥â–¥
You found a square gem!
â—†â—†â—†
â—† â—†
â—†â—†â—†
```

## Concepts Demonstrated

* Recursion instead of iteration
* Randomized encounters and structures
* File-based grammar-driven text generation
* String manipulation and ASCII art
