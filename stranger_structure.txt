<warning>: <danger> | <mystery>

<danger>: the dungeon is cursed. | monsters lurk in every corner. | the stairs lead only deeper into darkness. | the mirror realm twists your soul.

<mystery>: not all treasures are what they seem. | a rare diamond may bring both fortune and doom. | the stranger you meet may not be real.

<advice>: <guidance> | <guidance> <extra>

<guidance>: do not trust the mirrors. | follow the sound of dripping water. | take the left path when the torches flicker. | leave behind what you cannot carry.

<extra>: and remember, <reminder> | for soon, <reminder>

<reminder>: the dungeon watches you. | your choices shape your fate. | every step echoes forever. | no one escapes unchanged.
